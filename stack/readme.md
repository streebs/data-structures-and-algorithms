# Stack

Here is a program that utilizes a stack to solve mathematical expressions

### Overview

This program analyzes mathematical expressions in infix notation, and converts it postfix notaion, according to precedence, and evaluates the expression. 

### Why a Stack?

Stacks are incredibly useful when dealing with expressions that contain peices that have precedence over other pieces. For example, in a mathematical expression, order of operations tell us what parts of the expression we should solve first. we utilized a stack to keep track of pieces that have lower precidence. Stacks are also incredibly useful in parsing, and semantic analysis for programming languages.


# Run This Program
This program has been compiled on a linux os for x86 architecture. The executable is located in this directory as dynarray.exe you can run it with the following command:
