# Sorting


### Overview

This program implements 4 sorting algorithms and times each algorithm to compare speed. The program uses selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. merge sort and quick sort use recursion. Sorts an array of 100,000 integers

### Sorting and Time Complexity

Like the searching algorithms, some are faster than others. Merge sort and quick sort are by far faster than selection sort and insertion sort. The only time selection and insertion sorts are either faster or comparable to merge and quick is when the sorting size is small. in other words merge and quick sort are faster and the number of sorted elements grow.

### Run This Program
This program has been compiled on a linux os for x86 architecture. The executable is located in this directory as sort.exe you can run it with the following command:
```sh
./sorting/sort.exe
