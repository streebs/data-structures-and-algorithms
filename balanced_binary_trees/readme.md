# Balanced Binary Tree (AVL Tree)

### Overview

This project constructs a binary tree similar to the binary search tree in this repo. However this project implements the balancing algorithm when removing nodes from the tree

### Why Balance?

A balanced tree is more efficient than a non-balanced one. imagine a tree with a long string a of left children and only one right child at the root. if we balance that tree we can reduce the number of nodes traversed when searching for a node

### Run This Program
This program has been compiled on a linux os for x86 architecture. The executable is located in this directory as avl.exe you can run it with the following command:
```sh
./balanced_binary_tree/avl.exe 
```
