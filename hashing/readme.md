### Overview

This project stores every word from the Alice In Wonderland story and keeps track of the most used words. This particular Hashing array is a simple algorithms. It sums up the ascii values of each character in a string and adds it to a multiple of 2 prime numbers.

### Why a Hash Map?

Hash maps have the ability to store information more efficiently than a typical array. data is stored in a table like manner with a keys and values that make table lookups a bit quicker. This particular Hashing array is a simple algorithms. It sums up the ascii values of each character in a string and adds it to a multiple of 2 prime numbers.
