# Recursive Linked List

### Overview 

"Recursive!" you say? I know, this is a very impracticle way to implement a linked list. However, in college, They asked us to build it this way to get practice with recursion. So, at the very least it's kind of cool! This program manages a linked list of courses read in from stdin. The program creates Course objects and inserts them into a linked list. The linked list has built in functions that are implemented with recusion.

### Why a Linked List?

Unlike arrays, data contained in a linked lists are not stored in a linear piece of memory. Nodes in a linked list contain a pointer to the next node (and a pointer to the previous node for doubly linked lists). 

Linked lists provide similar benefits that a dynamic array provides. Such as dynamic memory allocation. linked lists also provide the benefit of being able to insert and remove elements in place efficiently.


### Run This Program
This program has been compiled on a linux os for x86 architecture. The executable is located in this directory as recursivell.exe you can run it with the following command:
