# Weighted Graphs & Dijkstras Algorithm

### Overview

This project creates a graph object with member functions that adds verticies and edges with weights. the Graph class also runs the Dijkstras algorithm for finding shortest path from a given starting vertex.

### Dijkstras

Graphs are integral to modern technology. Google Maps, flight scheduling software, delivery routes, internet traffic, search engines, etc. All of these use a graph of some sort. an algorithm like Dijkstras is useful in many of these cases. It should be stated that Dijkstras is a relatively fast algorithm for finding shortest path.

# Run This Program
This program has been compiled on a linux os for x86 architecture. The executable is located in this directory as graph.exe you can run it with the following command:
```sh
./djikstras/graph.exe 
```
