# Data Structures And Algorithms

I wanted to put this repo together because I love data structures & algorithms! These were fun projects that were very formative for me in my early years of programming. Like famous equations in math, data structures and algorithms are elegent (and beautiful!) solutions to some interesting problems that arise in the world of computing. I also wanted to display my learning and ability with C++ and programming in general.

Each directory contains a different project from my Sophomore Data Structures & Algorithms class in college. Each project contains the source code, an executable, and a readme for some notes about the project. 

For example

    sorting
        source
            ...
        readme.md
        sort.exe

*each executable was compiled with gcc on Ubuntu x86. Feel free to compile the source code yourself*
